# Ninjapages
[Website (v0.1)]("http://ninjapages.herokuapp.com")

Ninjapages is a node.js based website where users can quickly develop and deploy HTML5 websites in the cloud, whether on our mobile app, on this website or simply on your local machine. Ninjapages is currently in its alpha stage. See <a href='http://wrightdev.herokuapp.com' style='text-decoration:none;color:#006EFF;'>here</a> if you'd like to either contribute to the project, or ask us question.
